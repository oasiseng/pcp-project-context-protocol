# WindCalculations — Documents Required (Master)

This master file centralizes source documents and dependency relationships across all WindCalculations subcategories.

## Purpose

- Enable reusable, automation-friendly document source IDs.
- Distinguish client-provided vs external/code vs internally generated documents.
- Support dynamic checklist generation and permit-package validation.

## Subcategory Dependency Maps

## WC-DOOR

### Required Client-Provided Inputs

- FPA or NOA (full PDF)
- Manufacturer installation instructions
- Door cut sheet (model and size)
- Tested pressure ratings (± psf)
- Opening photos (optional, recommended)
- Architectural elevation/framing detail (if available)
- Permit application (if already submitted)

### Required External/Code Sources

- `doc_fbc_2023`
- `doc_asce_7_22`
- `doc_asce_hazard_tool`
- HVHZ 175 mph override (FBC 1620.2)
- CPSC 16 CFR 1201 (if laminated glazing)

### Required Internal Deliverables

- Signed and sealed wind certification letter
- Wind calculation report (MecaWind)
- Pressure comparison summary table
- Google Maps location exhibit
- Pressure zone diagram (Zone 4 typical)

### Relationship Logic

1. Address → ASCE Hazard Tool → confirm `Vult`.
2. Door size → effective area → ASCE 7 Table 30.3.
3. Zone 4 pressure → compare to FPA/NOA tested rating.
4. If rating ≥ required pressure → approve in sealed letter.

---

## WC-WINDOW

Includes WC-DOOR baseline requirements, plus:

### Additional Required Inputs

- Mullion details (for multi-unit assembly)
- Combination approval sheet (grouped units)
- Glass type verification (tempered/laminated)
- Anchor schedule from NOA

### Additional Relationship Logic

1. Unit grouping → effective area adjustment.
2. Mullion span → governing pressure.
3. Anchorage schedule → embedment/attachment verification.

3. Zone pressures → RAS 127 computation.
4. λ, `Mg`, `Mf` extracted from NOA.
5. `Mr required ≤ Mf provided` → PASS.
6. Populate HVHZ form sections A–E.
7. Attach NOAs and issue signed letter.

### Required Inputs

- Roof framing plan (critical)
- Truss or rafter specifications
- Mounting system approval
- Fastener withdrawal capacity
- Dead load of solar system
- Attachment layout plan

### Relationship Logic

1. Wind pressure on panel → tributary area per anchor.
2. Anchor uplift demand → withdrawal capacity.
3. Deck type → fastener embedment.
4. Framing member → bending/shear verification.

---

## WC-RAILING

### Required Inputs

- Railing NOA or shop drawing
- Mounting detail
- Elevation height above grade
- Exposure confirmation
- Anchor detail

### Relationship Logic

1. Height above grade → velocity pressure.
2. Open-structure coefficient → adjusted pressure.
3. Required psf → compare to tested system capacity.

---

## WC-MISC-CNC

### Required Inputs

- Product approval
- Component size

- Zone location on building
- Anchor schedule

---

## Implementation Notes

- Use the `document_id` entries above as canonical references in intake schemas and validation logic.
- For each project, map each required source to one of three states: `provided`, `pending`, or `not_applicable`.
- Treat relationship logic steps as pass/fail checkpoints that drive permit-package completeness.
