# WC-METAL-ROOF Calculation Logic

## Engineering Dependencies
- ASCE 7-22 C&C zone pressures
- Pressure demand versus tested assembly resistance
- Clip spacing and panel span conformance
- Attachment compatibility with deck type

## Additional Check
If project conditions exceed tested assembly limits, perform project-specific engineering calculations.
