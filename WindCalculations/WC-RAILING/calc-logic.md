# WC-RAILING Calculation Logic

## Engineering Dependencies
- ASCE 7 C&C pressures
- ASD pressure basis where applicable (example case: 59 psf)
- Open structure effects and effective area assumptions

## Approval Logic
Compute required pressure and compare to tested/approved system capacity and anchorage limits.
