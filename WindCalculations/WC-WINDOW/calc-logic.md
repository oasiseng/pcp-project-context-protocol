# WC-WINDOW Calculation Logic

## Engineering Notes
- Use correct effective area for each window or combined assembly.
- Verify CPSC glazing callout when laminated glazing is used.
- Check anchorage schedule compatibility with substrate.
- Apply ASCE 7-22 C&C zone pressures, including HVHZ override where applicable.

## Approval Logic
1. Compute required pressure.
2. Compare required pressure to FPA tested pressure by configuration.
3. If tested pressure >= required pressure, approve and issue letter.
